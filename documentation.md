What part of your phenomenon would you like to build a model of?
What are the principal types of agents involved in this phenomenon?
In what kind of environment do these agents operate? Are there environmental agents?
What properties do these agents have (describe by agent type)?
What actions (or behaviors) can these agents take (describe by agent type)?
How do these agents interact with this environment or each other?
If you had to define the phenomenon as discrete time steps, what events would occur in each time step, and in what order?
What do you hope to observe from this model?
